# CURA Bricklayers

This repository is the starting point for the CURA Bricklayers project. At the moment it only contains this
README, which outlines the expected scope of work and the next steps for building out the codebase.

## Project overview

CURA Bricklayers is envisioned as a digital home for a bricklaying and masonry services team. The repository will
ultimately contain the source code for marketing pages, job management tools, and any supporting infrastructure. As
the project evolves, keep this document updated with architecture decisions and operational guidelines.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Python virtual environment or the tooling that best fits the implementation approach you choose.
3. Add the initial application scaffolding (for example, a web framework or static site generator).
4. Capture setup steps here so new contributors can reproduce your environment easily.

## Repository structure

```
.
└── README.md  # Project documentation and planning notes
```

Expand this section as new directories and files are added.

## Development workflow

* Use feature branches for work in progress and open pull requests for review.
* Run linting and tests locally before committing once the project has executable code.
* Update this README with clear instructions whenever the workflow changes.

## Testing

No automated tests are available yet. As functionality is introduced, document the commands required to run tests or
other verification steps.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository or create a branch in this repository if you have access.
2. Make your changes with descriptive commit messages.
3. Ensure all tests pass once they exist.
4. Submit a pull request for review.

## License
